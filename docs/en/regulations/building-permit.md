# Building Permit

The building permit (*pozwolenie na budowe*) is the main authorization required before starting construction in Poland. This page covers the full process: when a permit is needed, what documents to prepare, how to submit, and how to handle rejections.

::: info Legal basis
Building permits are regulated by **Art. 28--40 of Prawo Budowlane** ([Construction Law](/en/regulations/prawo-budowlane)). The administrative procedure follows the Code of Administrative Procedure (*Kodeks postepowania administracyjnego*).

## Permit vs Notification vs No Permit

Not every construction activity requires a full building permit. The table below summarizes the three categories.

| Category | Examples | Procedure |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Building permit required** | New buildings over 35 m2, multi-family housing, public buildings, buildings taller than 12 m, structures in conservation zones | Full permit application (this page) |
| **Notification (*zgloszenie*) sufficient** | Single-family houses up to 70 m2 (under certain conditions), fences over 2.2 m, internal gas installations, small garden structures, some renovations | Submit notification; 21-day silence = approval |
| **No permit or notification** | Structures under 35 m2 on plots over 500 m2 (max 2 per plot), temporary market stalls, small garden features, maintenance works | Proceed directly |

::: warning Single-family houses under simplified notification
Since 2022, single-family houses can use a simplified notification (*zgloszenie z projektem*) if: the building area does not exceed 70 m2, the building is for the applicant's own housing needs, and has a maximum of 2 stories. However, restrictions apply and the investor assumes the role of kierownik budowy. Verify current conditions before relying on this path.

## Required Documents Checklist

Prepare the following before submitting your building permit application:

| # | Document | Details |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Application form** | Standardized form (PB-1), available at the starostwo or online |
| 2 | **Construction project** (*projekt budowlany*) | 3 copies in paper + digital copy. Must include: project plan (*projekt zagospodarowania dzialki*), architectural-construction project (*projekt architektoniczno-budowlany*), and technical project (*projekt techniczny*) |
| 3 | **Proof of right to the plot** | Land register excerpt, notarial deed, or a declaration of the right to dispose of the property for construction purposes (*oswiadczenie o prawie do dysponowania nieruchomoscia na cele budowlane*) |
| 4 | **MPZP excerpt or WZ decision** | [Zoning documentation](/en/regulations/zoning-mpzp-wz) -- certified excerpt from the local plan, or a final zoning decision |
| 5 | **Utility connection conditions** | Technical conditions from providers: water/sewer, electricity, gas, telecom, road access |
| 6 | **Geotechnical opinion** | Soil and groundwater assessment for the plot |
| 7 | **Stamp duty proof** | Payment confirmation (see [fees](/en/regulations/fees)) |
| 8 | **Other permits/opinions** | As required: conservation officer approval, environmental decision, fire protection opinion, sanitary inspection opinion, road manager consent for access |

::: tip Prepare the project in the correct format
Since 2021, the construction project is divided into three parts: PZT (site plan), PAB (architectural-construction project), and PT (technical project). Only PZT and PAB are submitted with the permit application. PT is kept by the investor and presented to the site manager before construction starts. See [design development phase](/en/phases/design-development) for project structure details.

## Application Process -- Step by Step

| Step | Action | Who | Timeline |
|------|--------|-----|----------|
| 1 | Gather all required documents | Architect / Investor | Before submission |
| 2 | Submit application to the **starostwo powiatowe** (county office) or city office for cities with county rights | Investor | Day 0 |
| 3 | Office checks formal completeness | Authority | 7--14 days |
| 4 | If incomplete, the office issues a **request for corrections** (*wezwanie do uzupelnienia brakow*) | Authority | Sets a deadline (usually 7--14 days) |
| 5 | Authority reviews the project for compliance with zoning, [WT 2021](/en/regulations/wt-2021), and Prawo Budowlane | Authority | Within the 65-day period |
| 6 | Neighbors and parties to the proceeding are notified | Authority | 14 days to respond |
| 7 | **Decision is issued** -- permit granted or denied | Authority | **Statutory deadline: 65 days** from complete application |
| 8 | 14-day appeal period for all parties | All parties | After delivery |
| 9 | Permit becomes **final** (*ostateczna*) | -- | After appeal period expires without appeal |

::: info The 65-day clock
The 65-day statutory deadline does not include time spent waiting for the applicant to correct deficiencies, time for obtaining opinions from other authorities, or force majeure interruptions. In practice, the process often takes 3--4 months.

## Common Rejection Reasons and How to Avoid Them

| Rejection reason | How to prevent it |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Incomplete documentation | Use the checklist above; have a second person review the package before submission |
| Project does not comply with MPZP/WZ | Cross-check every design parameter against the [zoning requirements](/en/regulations/zoning-mpzp-wz) before finalizing the project |
| Missing or expired utility conditions | Request utility conditions early in the [initiation phase](/en/phases/initiation); confirm validity dates |
| Designer lacks valid professional license | Verify license (*uprawnienia budowlane*) and current chamber membership (*izba*) for all designers |
| Insufficient fire safety documentation | For buildings requiring fire protection review, obtain the fire officer's opinion before submission |
| Plot access to a public road not established | Resolve road access (easement or road manager's consent) before applying |
| Non-compliant with WT 2021 | Run a compliance check against [Technical Conditions](/en/regulations/wt-2021) before submission |

## Appeal Process

If the permit is denied or conditions are imposed that you disagree with:

1. **File an appeal** (*odwolanie*) to the **Voivodship Governor** (*wojewoda*) within **14 days** of receiving the decision.
2. Submit the appeal through the authority that issued the original decision (the starostwo forwards it).
3. The appeal body reviews the case and issues a decision within **30 days** (often longer in practice).
4. If the appeal is rejected, you may file a complaint to the **Voivodship Administrative Court** (*WSA*) within 30 days.

::: tip Practical approach to appeals
Before filing a formal appeal, discuss the rejection reasons with the reviewing officer. Many issues can be resolved by correcting the documentation and resubmitting, which is faster than the appeal route.

## Permit Validity and Expiry

- The building permit is valid **indefinitely** but construction must **start within 3 years** from the date the permit becomes final.
- If construction is interrupted for more than **3 years**, the permit expires.
- An expired permit requires a **new application** from scratch.
- Before starting construction, complete the [construction formalities](/en/regulations/construction-formalities): appoint a site manager, register the construction log, and notify PINB.

## Permit Transfer

A building permit can be **transferred to a new investor** without a new application:

1. The new investor submits a transfer application to the same authority.
2. The new investor must provide proof of the right to the plot and accept all permit conditions.
3. The original permit holder must consent (or a court ruling must exist).
4. The authority issues a transfer decision, typically within 30 days.

## Practical Tips

- Start document collection at least **2 months** before the planned submission date.
- Submit the application **in person** and request a confirmation stamp on your copy -- this establishes the official submission date.
- Track the 65-day deadline. If the authority exceeds it, you can file a complaint about inactivity (*skarga na bezczynnosc*).
- Coordinate with your [project management](/en/project-management/) schedule -- the permit process is typically the longest single milestone in the [initiation phase](/en/phases/initiation).
- Keep one complete copy of the submitted project for your records.
