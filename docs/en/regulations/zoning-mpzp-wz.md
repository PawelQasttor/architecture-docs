# Zoning: MPZP & WZ

Every building project in Poland starts with a zoning check. Two instruments govern what you can build on a given plot: the **Local Spatial Plan (MPZP)** and the **Zoning Decision (WZ)**. This page explains both, how to read them, and how to use them in your project workflow.

::: info Legal basis
Zoning is regulated by the **Act on Spatial Planning and Development** (*Ustawa o planowaniu i zagospodarowaniu przestrzennym*, 27 March 2003). MPZP and WZ decisions must also comply with [Prawo Budowlane](/en/regulations/prawo-budowlane) and [WT 2021](/en/regulations/wt-2021).

## MPZP vs WZ at a Glance

| Aspect | MPZP (Local Spatial Plan) | WZ (Zoning Decision) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **What it is** | A local law adopted by the municipal council | An individual administrative decision |
| **When it applies** | Plot is covered by an adopted plan | Plot has no MPZP in force |
| **Who issues it** | Municipal council (*rada gminy*) | Mayor / city president (*wójt / burmistrz / prezydent*) |
| **Binding on** | All plots within the plan area | Only the specific plot and applicant |
| **Typical timeline** | Already in force (just obtain an excerpt) | 2--6 months from application |
| **Validity** | Indefinite (until amended or repealed) | Indefinite, but can be revoked if MPZP is adopted |
| **Cost to applicant** | Free excerpt; certified copy ~50 PLN | 598 PLN stamp duty (exempt for residential buildings) |
| **Neighbor participation** | During plan adoption (public consultation) | Neighbors are parties to the proceeding |
| **Appeal** | Challenge via administrative court | Appeal to SKO within 14 days |

## MPZP -- Local Spatial Plan

### What It Contains

An MPZP consists of two parts:

1. **Text (uchwala)** -- the legal provisions: permitted land uses, building parameters, restrictions.
2. **Drawing (rysunek)** -- a map showing zone boundaries, building lines, protected areas.

### Key Parameters to Extract

When reading an MPZP for your plot, focus on these parameters:

| Parameter | Polish term | What it controls |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Land use designation | Przeznaczenie terenu | Allowed functions (residential, commercial, mixed) |
| Building line | Linia zabudowy | Mandatory or maximum distance from road |
| Building height | Maksymalna wysokosc zabudowy | Maximum height in meters or number of stories |
| Building intensity | Intensywnosc zabudowy | Ratio of total floor area to plot area |
| Building coverage | Maksymalna powierzchnia zabudowy | Maximum percentage of plot that can be built on |
| Biologically active area | Powierzchnia biologicznie czynna | Minimum percentage of green/permeable area |
| Roof form | Forma dachu | Flat, pitched, specific angle ranges |
| Parking requirements | Wskazniki parkingowe | Minimum parking spaces per unit or per m2 |

::: tip Reading the plan drawing
Zone designations use standardized letter codes: **MN** = single-family residential, **MW** = multi-family residential, **U** = services, **P** = industrial, **ZP** = public green space. A designation like **MN/U** means mixed residential-services.
:::

### How to Obtain an MPZP Excerpt

1. Check if an MPZP exists for your plot at the municipal planning office or on the local geoportal.
2. Submit a request for an **excerpt and drawing extract** (*wypis i wyrys z MPZP*) at the municipal office.
3. The municipality issues the excerpt within 7 days (practice: up to 2--3 weeks).
4. A certified copy costs approximately 50 PLN per page; a plain information note is free.

## WZ -- Zoning Decision (*Warunki Zabudowy*)

### When You Need a WZ

You must apply for a WZ decision when:

- There is **no MPZP** in force for the plot.
- You want to **build a new structure**, extend, or change the use of an existing building.

::: warning When WZ is not needed
WZ is not required for temporary structures (up to 180 days), internal renovations that do not change the building's function, or works that only require a [building notification](/en/regulations/building-permit).
:::

### WZ Application -- Required Documents

1. **Application form** (available at the municipal office or ePUAP).
2. **Map excerpt** -- a copy of the base map (*mapa zasadnicza*) at 1:500 or 1:1000 scale, with the plot boundary and proposed building footprint marked. Obtain this from the county geodetic office (*PODGiK*).
3. **Preliminary utility statements** -- confirmations from utility providers (water, sewer, electricity, gas) that infrastructure is available or can be extended.
4. **Description of the planned investment** -- function, approximate dimensions, number of stories, intended use.
5. **Proof of stamp duty payment** -- 598 PLN (exempt for residential buildings for the applicant's own housing needs).

### WZ Application Process -- Step by Step

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Submit the application to the municipal planning office | Day 0 |
| 2 | Office checks formal completeness; may request corrections | 7--14 days |
| 3 | Office notifies neighbors (parties to proceeding) | 14 days for parties to respond |
| 4 | Urban planning analysis (*analiza urbanistyczna*) is performed | Included in review |
| 5 | Draft decision is prepared | Variable |
| 6 | Decision is issued | Total: 60 days statutory (often 3--6 months in practice) |
| 7 | 14-day appeal period for all parties | After delivery |
| 8 | Decision becomes final (*prawomocna*) | After appeal period expires |

::: info Indefinite validity
A WZ decision does not expire. However, it becomes void if an MPZP is adopted for the area and the WZ is inconsistent with the new plan. Start the [building permit](/en/regulations/building-permit) process promptly after receiving WZ.

## Step-by-Step: How to Check Zoning for a Plot

Follow this procedure during the [initiation phase](/en/phases/initiation) of every project:

1. **Identify the plot** -- obtain the plot number (*numer dzialki*) and precinct (*obreb*) from the land register or the national geoportal (geoportal.gov.pl).
2. **Check for MPZP coverage** -- visit the local municipality website or the national spatial information system (sip.gis.gov.pl). Many cities publish interactive plan maps.
3. **If MPZP exists** -- request an excerpt and drawing extract from the municipality. Read the parameters listed above and verify your design concept fits within them.
4. **If no MPZP exists** -- apply for a WZ decision using the process described above.
5. **Check for additional restrictions** -- look for conservation zones, flood risk areas, Natura 2000 sites, monument protection, and airport restriction zones. These can override or add to MPZP/WZ parameters.
6. **Document everything** -- include the MPZP excerpt or WZ decision in your [design development](/en/phases/design-development) package and reference it in the building permit application.

## Common Pitfalls

::: warning Watch out for these issues

- **No road access** -- a WZ decision requires that the plot has access to a public road (directly or via an established easement). Verify this before purchasing land or starting design.
- **Neighbor objections** -- in WZ proceedings, neighbors are formal parties. Their objections can delay the process by months. Engage early and informally where possible.
- **Inconsistent WZ parameters** -- the urban planning analysis is based on the character of surrounding development. If the area is varied, the resulting WZ parameters may be restrictive or contradictory. Review the draft decision carefully.
- **MPZP adopted after WZ** -- if a new MPZP is adopted and your WZ contradicts it, the WZ is revoked. Monitor local plan adoption schedules.
- **Split zoning** -- a plot may be partially covered by MPZP and partially not, or may fall under two different MPZP zones. Each part must be analyzed separately.
- **Outdated plans** -- some MPZPs date from the 1990s and may reference repealed regulations. Check the adoption date and any amendments.

## Practical Tips

- Always obtain a **certified excerpt** (*wypis*), not just informal information, before submitting a [building permit](/en/regulations/building-permit) application.
- For WZ applications, submit **more detailed descriptions** than the minimum -- this gives the office less room to impose unexpected conditions.
- Use the MPZP/WZ parameters to set up your design constraints in the [project management](/en/project-management/) system early.
- If the MPZP is under preparation (*w trakcie opracowania*), check the draft plan -- your project may need to anticipate future requirements.
- Keep a record of all zoning documents in the project file for the [as-built documentation](/en/phases/as-built) phase.
