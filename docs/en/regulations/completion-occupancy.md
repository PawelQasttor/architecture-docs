# Completion & Occupancy

When construction is finished, you must formally close the project before the building can be used. Polish law provides two paths: a **completion notification** (*zawiadomienie o zakonczeniu budowy*) and an **occupancy permit** (*pozwolenie na uzytkowanie*). Choosing the wrong path or missing required documents is a common source of delays.

::: info Legal basis
Completion and occupancy procedures are regulated by **Art. 54--60 of Prawo Budowlane** ([Construction Law](/en/regulations/prawo-budowlane)). The detailed documentation requirements link to [WT 2021](/en/regulations/wt-2021) compliance verification.

## Two Paths Compared

| Aspect | Completion Notification | Occupancy Permit |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Polish term** | Zawiadomienie o zakonczeniu budowy | Pozwolenie na uzytkowanie |
| **When to use** | Most residential buildings, standard projects built according to the permit | Public buildings (category IX--XXX), buildings with deviations from the permit, or when partial occupancy is needed |
| **Submitted to** | PINB (county building inspection) | PINB (county building inspection) |
| **Approval mechanism** | **14-day silence rule** -- if PINB does not object within 14 days, you may occupy the building | PINB conducts a **mandatory inspection** and issues a formal decision |
| **Inspection** | PINB may inspect but is not obligated to | PINB must inspect before issuing the permit |
| **Timeline** | 14 days from submission (if no objection) | 21--60 days in practice |
| **Cost** | No fee | 25% of the permit fee for the relevant building category (see [fees](/en/regulations/fees)) |
| **Risk** | PINB can object within 14 days and require corrections | Inspection may reveal non-compliance, delaying the permit |

## Completion Notification -- Step by Step

Use this path for standard residential and other buildings that do not require an occupancy permit.

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Confirm all works are finished | The building must be complete in accordance with the building permit and approved project |
| 2 | Collect all required documents | See the document checklist below |
| 3 | Site manager makes a final entry in the construction log | Declares construction is complete and compliant |
| 4 | Submit the notification to PINB | Include all required attachments |
| 5 | Wait 14 days | The "silence means consent" rule applies |
| 6 | If no objection -- **building may be occupied** | Keep the confirmation of notification submission as proof |
| 7 | If PINB objects -- address the issues and resubmit | PINB will specify what needs to be corrected |

::: tip Confirming the 14-day period
Request a written confirmation from PINB that no objection was raised. While not legally required, this document is useful for property sales, bank mortgage releases, and administrative records.
:::

## Occupancy Permit -- Step by Step

This path is required for public buildings, buildings where the investor wants to occupy before full completion, or when deviations from the permit occurred.

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Submit an occupancy permit application to PINB | Include all required documents |
| 2 | PINB schedules an inspection | Within 21 days of receiving a complete application |
| 3 | PINB inspection takes place | Inspectors verify compliance with the building permit, project, and applicable regulations |
| 4 | PINB issues the decision | Permit granted, granted with conditions, or denied |
| 5 | 14-day appeal period | Parties can appeal to the provincial inspector (*WINB*) |
| 6 | Decision becomes final | Building may be occupied |

::: warning Mandatory occupancy permit cases
An occupancy permit is **always** required for: public-use buildings (schools, hospitals, offices open to the public), buildings taller than 12 m or with more than 4 above-ground stories, buildings where significant deviations from the permit occurred, and cases where the investor wants to use the building before completing all works (partial occupancy).
:::

## Required Documents -- Both Paths

The documents below are required for both the completion notification and the occupancy permit application. Gather them during the [construction phase](/en/phases/construction).

| # | Document | Source |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Original construction log** (or electronic log access) | Site manager |
| 2 | **Site manager's declaration** (*oswiadczenie kierownika budowy*) that construction was completed in accordance with the permit, approved project, and applicable regulations | Site manager |
| 3 | **Site manager's declaration** on bringing the site and adjacent areas to order | Site manager |
| 4 | **As-built geodetic survey** (*geodezyjna inwentaryzacja powykonawcza*) | Licensed surveyor |
| 5 | **Energy performance certificate** (*swiadectwo charakterystyki energetycznej*) | Certified energy auditor |
| 6 | **Protocols from required installations tests**: electrical (insulation resistance, grounding), gas leak test, chimney/ventilation inspection, water/sewer pressure test | Licensed specialists |
| 7 | **Documentation of material changes** (if any non-significant deviations occurred) with designer's annotations | Architect / designer |
| 8 | **Proof of utility connections** | Utility providers |
| 9 | **Copy of the building permit** and approved project (PZT and PAB) | Investor's files |
| 10 | **Fire protection documentation** (for buildings requiring fire officer approval) | Fire safety specialist |

::: info As-built geodetic survey
The as-built geodetic survey (*geodezyjna inwentaryzacja powykonawcza*) must be prepared by a licensed surveyor and submitted to the county geodetic office (*PODGiK*) before you file the completion notification. Processing by PODGiK can take 2--4 weeks, so plan accordingly during the [as-built phase](/en/phases/as-built).
:::

## Common Problems and How to Avoid Them

| Problem | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| **Missing geodetic survey** | Commission the surveyor well before construction ends; allow time for PODGiK processing |
| **Incomplete installation protocols** | Schedule all installation tests 2--3 weeks before planned completion; keep a checklist |
| **Deviations from the permit not documented** | The designer should perform regular author's supervision visits during [construction](/en/phases/construction) and document all changes in the construction log |
| **Energy certificate not prepared** | Commission the energy certificate as soon as the building envelope and installations are complete |
| **PINB objection to the completion notification** | Ensure all documents are complete before submission; PINB commonly objects to missing geodetic surveys or installation protocols |
| **Construction log entries incomplete or illegible** | The site manager should make regular, detailed entries; for paper logs, use clear handwriting in ink |
| **Building does not match the approved project** | Significant deviations require a permit amendment *before* completion, not after -- monitor compliance throughout construction |
| **Partial completion declared but not all essential systems operational** | For occupancy permits with partial use, clearly define which parts are complete and safe for occupation |

## Post-Completion Obligations

After the building is occupied, the owner assumes ongoing responsibilities:

| Obligation | Frequency | Legal basis |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Periodic building inspections** (annual) | Every year | Art. 62 ust. 1 pkt 1 Prawo Budowlane |
| **Five-year comprehensive inspection** | Every 5 years | Art. 62 ust. 1 pkt 2 Prawo Budowlane |
| **Chimney and ventilation inspection** | Annually | Art. 62 ust. 1 pkt 1 lit. c |
| **Gas installation inspection** | Annually | Art. 62 ust. 1 pkt 1 lit. c |
| **Electrical installation inspection** | Every 5 years (at minimum) | Art. 62 ust. 1 pkt 2 |
| **Building log book** (*ksiazka obiektu budowlanego*) | Maintained continuously | Art. 64 Prawo Budowlane |

::: tip Building log book (KOB)
Since 2023, the building log book can be maintained electronically (*Cyfrowa Ksiazka Obiektu Budowlanego*, c-KOB) through the government system. All inspection results, repairs, and modifications must be recorded. Set this up as part of the [handover phase](/en/phases/handover) deliverables.

## Practical Tips

- Begin collecting completion documents **at least 4 weeks** before the planned completion date.
- Create a completion document tracker in your [project management](/en/project-management/) system to monitor which documents are ready.
- For the completion notification, submit early in the week -- the 14-day period counts calendar days, and PINB offices are closed on weekends.
- If your project involves multiple stages, each stage requires its own completion process.
- Keep the original construction log (or ensure electronic log access) -- it will be needed for any future modifications or inspections.
