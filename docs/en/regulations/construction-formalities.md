# Construction Formalities

Once you have a [building permit](/en/regulations/building-permit) (or valid notification), several formal requirements must be met before and during construction. This page covers the key roles, documents, and notifications required on a Polish construction site.

::: info Legal basis
Construction site requirements are defined in **Art. 41--46 of Prawo Budowlane** ([Construction Law](/en/regulations/prawo-budowlane)). Detailed obligations for site participants are specified in Art. 21--27 of the same act.

## Before Construction Starts -- Checklist

Complete these steps after receiving a final building permit and before any work begins on site:

| # | Action | Responsible party |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Appoint a **kierownik budowy** (site manager) | Investor |
| 2 | Register the **dziennik budowy** (construction log) | Investor / site manager |
| 3 | Submit a **notification of construction start** to PINB | Investor |
| 4 | Place the **information board** on site | Site manager |
| 5 | Secure the site (fencing, safety measures) | Site manager |
| 6 | Appoint an **inspektor nadzoru inwestorskiego** if required | Investor |
| 7 | Ensure the **technical project** (*projekt techniczny*) is on site | Investor / architect |

::: warning Wait for PINB confirmation
You must notify PINB (*Powiatowy Inspektorat Nadzoru Budowlanego*) at least **7 days** before starting construction. Attach the site manager's declaration, construction log registration, and proof of the final building permit. Do not begin any works before this notification is submitted.

## Kierownik Budowy (Site Manager)

### Who Can Be a Site Manager

A kierownik budowy must hold:

- **Construction professional license** (*uprawnienia budowlane*) in the relevant specialty (architectural or structural, in the appropriate scope).
- **Active membership** in the relevant professional chamber (*izba inzynierow budownictwa* or *izba architektow*).
- **Valid professional liability insurance** (provided through chamber membership).

### Responsibilities

The site manager is personally responsible for:

| Area | Specific duties |
|------|----------------|
| **Site safety** | Preparing and enforcing the health & safety plan (*plan BIOZ*); securing the site; ensuring workers have safety training |
| **Construction log** | Making entries, recording progress, deviations, inspections, and weather conditions |
| **Code compliance** | Verifying that works comply with the building permit, approved project, [WT 2021](/en/regulations/wt-2021), and relevant standards |
| **Quality control** | Checking materials, supervising critical construction phases (foundations, structure, waterproofing) |
| **Documentation** | Maintaining as-built records, collecting material certificates, preparing the site for [completion](/en/regulations/completion-occupancy) |
| **Deviation management** | Assessing whether changes are significant or non-significant deviations from the permit; significant deviations require a permit amendment |

::: tip Appointment timing
Appoint the kierownik budowy immediately after receiving the final building permit. Their declaration (*oswiadczenie*) is required for the PINB notification. Include this appointment in your [project management](/en/project-management/) timeline.
:::

## Dziennik Budowy (Construction Log)

### What It Is

The construction log is an **official document** that records the entire construction process from start to completion. Since January 2023, it can be maintained in **electronic form** (*Elektroniczny Dziennik Budowy*, EDB) through the government's online system (e-budownictwo.gunb.gov.pl).

### How to Obtain and Register It

| Format | Process |
|--------|---------|
| **Electronic (EDB)** | Register through the e-budownictwo platform; the system assigns a number and provides access to all authorized persons |
| **Paper** | Purchase a numbered, bound log from the county office (*starostwo*); register it at the same office before first use |

### Who Writes in the Construction Log

| Person | Type of entries |
|--------|----------------|
| **Kierownik budowy** | Daily progress, material deliveries, weather conditions, deviations, concealed works records |
| **Inspektor nadzoru inwestorskiego** | Inspection results, instructions to the site manager, acceptance of works |
| **Designer (architect/engineer)** | Author's supervision visits, compliance checks, clarifications |
| **PINB inspector** | Official inspection results, orders, and decisions |

::: info Rules for log entries
Every entry must include the date, the author's name, professional license number, and signature. In the paper version, entries are made in ink and cannot be erased -- corrections are made by crossing out with a single line and adding a note. The electronic version tracks all changes automatically.
:::

## Inspektor Nadzoru Inwestorskiego (Investor's Inspector)

### When Required

Appointing an investor's inspector is **mandatory** for:

- Buildings in categories listed in **Art. 18 ust. 2** of Prawo Budowlane (public-use buildings, buildings taller than 12 m, structures with unusual technical complexity).
- Projects where the building permit decision explicitly requires it.
- Structures where the **provincial inspector** (*wojewodzki inspektor nadzoru budowlanego*) orders it.

::: tip Even when not mandatory
For larger residential projects or complex renovations, appointing an investor's inspector is strongly recommended. They protect the investor's interests and provide independent quality oversight during the [construction phase](/en/phases/construction).
:::

### Responsibilities and Qualifications

The investor's inspector represents the investor on site, verifies works match the approved project, checks quality, approves concealed works (e.g., reinforcement before concrete pour), confirms completion of construction phases, signs off in the construction log, and participates in the [completion and occupancy](/en/regulations/completion-occupancy) process. Same qualification requirements as the kierownik budowy: valid construction licenses, chamber membership, and liability insurance in the relevant specialty.

## Notifications to PINB

Several notifications must be submitted to the county building inspection authority (PINB) during the project:

| When | Notification | Documents to attach |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **7+ days before construction start** | Notification of intent to commence construction | Site manager declaration, construction log number, final building permit copy, health & safety plan declaration |
| **During construction** (if applicable) | Notification of significant deviation | Amended project, new permit decision |
| **At construction completion** | Completion notification or occupancy permit application | See [Completion & Occupancy](/en/regulations/completion-occupancy) |
| **Change of site manager** | Notification of site manager change | New site manager's declaration, old site manager's summary entry in log |

## Site Safety Requirements

The kierownik budowy must ensure compliance with health and safety regulations:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Health & Safety Plan (plan BIOZ)** | Required for projects involving particular risks (work at heights above 5 m, excavations deeper than 1.5 m, heavy equipment, demolition, hazardous materials). Prepared by the site manager before construction starts. |
| **Site fencing** | The construction site must be fenced and marked with warning signs. Entry restricted to authorized personnel. |
| **Information board** | A board at the site entrance must display: permit number, investor name, site manager name, designer name. |
| **Worker safety** | All workers must have valid health examinations (*badania lekarskie*) and safety training (*szkolenie BHP*). PPE must be provided. |
| **Fire safety** | Fire extinguishers and evacuation routes must be maintained. Particularly relevant for works involving hot processes (welding, roofing). |

::: warning Consequences of non-compliance
PINB can order construction to stop if safety requirements are not met. The site manager faces personal liability, including fines and potential loss of professional license. Non-compliance can also trigger criminal proceedings under workplace safety laws.
:::

## Required Site Documentation

Keep the following documents available on site at all times during the [construction phase](/en/phases/construction):

1. **Final building permit decision** (certified copy)
2. **Construction project** -- PZT, PAB, and PT (the technical project)
3. **Construction log** (paper or electronic access)
4. **Health & safety plan** (plan BIOZ), if required
5. **Material certificates and declarations of performance** for all materials used
6. **Geodetic survey** of the building stakeout (*wytyczenie geodezyjne*)
7. **Records of concealed works** (photos, protocols)
8. **Protocols from required inspections** (structural, installation, fire)
9. **Site manager's and inspector's professional license documents**

::: tip Digital documentation
Use the [project management](/en/project-management/) system to maintain digital copies of all site documents. This simplifies the transition to the [as-built phase](/en/phases/as-built) and speeds up the [handover](/en/phases/handover) process.
