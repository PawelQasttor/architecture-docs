# Administrative Fees

This page provides a practical reference for the fees and costs associated with building projects in Poland. Use it for budgeting during the [initiation phase](/en/phases/initiation) and for verifying payments throughout the project lifecycle.

::: info Legal basis
Administrative fees are regulated by the **Act on Stamp Duty** (*Ustawa o oplacie skarbowej*, 16 November 2006) and specific provisions of [Prawo Budowlane](/en/regulations/prawo-budowlane). Geodetic and utility fees are set by local authorities and service providers.

## Building Permit Fees

Building permit fees are calculated based on the building type and its usable area. Residential buildings for the applicant's own housing needs are **exempt** from the building permit fee.

### Fee Formula

For non-residential and non-exempt buildings, the fee is calculated per square meter of usable area:

| Building category | Fee per 1 m2 of usable area |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Residential buildings (not owner-occupied) | 1 PLN/m2 |
| Garages, shelters | 1 PLN/m2 |
| Commercial and service buildings | 1 PLN/m2 |
| Industrial and warehouse buildings | 0.25 PLN/m2 |
| Other buildings | 1 PLN/m2 |

::: tip Fee cap
The maximum building permit fee for a single building is capped at **539 PLN**. For structures that are not buildings (e.g., bridges, masts, technical infrastructure), fees are calculated differently -- consult the stamp duty schedule.
:::

### Fee Exemptions

The following are **exempt** from building permit fees:

- Residential buildings or parts thereof intended for the applicant's own housing needs.
- Buildings for public benefit activities (healthcare, education, social welfare).
- Agricultural buildings.
- Applications submitted by government budget units.

## Stamp Duty for Administrative Applications

| Application / Decision | Fee (PLN) | Notes |
|------------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Building permit** | Calculated per m2 (see above) | Exempt for owner-occupied residential |
| **Notification (*zgloszenie*)** | 0 PLN | No fee for construction notifications |
| **WZ decision** (zoning decision) | 598 PLN | Exempt for owner-occupied residential |
| **MPZP excerpt** (*wypis*) | Up to 50 PLN per page | Certified copy; informal information is free |
| **MPZP drawing extract** (*wyrys*) | Up to 50 PLN per page | Usually A3 or A4 format |
| **Transfer of building permit** | 90 PLN | To a new investor |
| **Occupancy permit** | 25% of permit fee | For the relevant building category |
| **Completion notification** | 0 PLN | No fee for standard completion notifications |
| **Power of attorney registration** | 17 PLN | Per power of attorney document |
| **Certificate / official confirmation** | 17 PLN | Per document |
| **Copy of administrative decision** | 5 PLN per page | Certified copies |

::: info Residential exemption
The stamp duty exemption for residential buildings applies when the building or part of it is intended for the applicant's own housing needs. If the building is partly residential and partly commercial, the fee applies only to the non-residential portion.

## Geodetic Survey Costs

Geodetic services are provided by licensed surveyors. Prices are market-based and vary by region. The ranges below are typical for 2024--2025.

| Service | Typical cost range (PLN) | When needed |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Base map for design** (*mapa do celow projektowych*) | 1 500 -- 4 000 | Before design; required for the construction project |
| **Plot subdivision** (*podzial dzialki*) | 3 000 -- 8 000 | If the plot needs to be divided |
| **Building stakeout** (*wytyczenie budynku*) | 1 000 -- 3 000 | Before construction starts |
| **As-built geodetic survey** (*inwentaryzacja powykonawcza*) | 1 500 -- 4 000 | Before [completion notification](/en/regulations/completion-occupancy) |
| **Land register map update** | 800 -- 2 000 | If boundaries need verification |

::: warning Budget for geodetic delays
Geodetic surveys require processing by the county geodetic office (*PODGiK*). Allow 2--4 weeks for map verification and registration. Factor this into your [project management](/en/project-management/) schedule, especially for the as-built survey before completion.
:::

## Utility Connection Fees

Utility connection fees vary significantly by provider and location. The table below shows typical ranges.

| Utility | Connection fee range (PLN) | Notes |
|---------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Water supply** | 1 500 -- 8 000 | Depends on pipe diameter and distance to main |
| **Sewage** | 2 000 -- 10 000 | Gravity vs pressure system; distance to collector |
| **Electricity** (standard residential, up to 40 kW) | 1 500 -- 7 000 | Based on connection power and distance to transformer |
| **Electricity** (commercial / high power) | 5 000 -- 50 000+ | Transformer installation may be required |
| **Gas** | 1 500 -- 5 000 | Distance to gas main; pipe diameter |
| **District heating** | 5 000 -- 30 000+ | Depends on connection capacity and local provider |
| **Telecom / fiber** | 0 -- 2 000 | Often free in urban areas with existing infrastructure |

::: tip Technical conditions first
Before budgeting for utility connections, request **technical conditions** (*warunki przyłączenia*) from each provider. These are usually free and will specify the exact connection fee, timeline, and any infrastructure the investor must build. Request these during the [initiation phase](/en/phases/initiation).

## PINB-Related Costs

| Item | Cost (PLN) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **PINB inspection** (occupancy permit) | No separate fee | Included in the occupancy permit fee |
| **Legalization fee** (unauthorized construction) | Variable, significant | Calculated based on building category and size; can range from thousands to hundreds of thousands of PLN |
| **Penalty for occupying without permit/notification** | 10 000 PLN | Per occurrence; imposed by PINB |
| **Penalty for late periodic inspection** | Up to 5 000 PLN | Per missed inspection deadline |

::: warning Unauthorized construction costs
The legalization fee for unauthorized construction (*samowola budowlana*) is calculated as 50x the standard building permit fee. For a 200 m2 commercial building, this could exceed 10 000 PLN. Always obtain proper permits before starting work. See [Building Permit](/en/regulations/building-permit) for the correct procedure.

## Payment Methods and Tips

- Most stamp duties can be paid by **bank transfer** to the municipality's account. Include the application reference in the transfer title.
- Some offices accept payment at the cashier's desk or via the **ePUAP** electronic platform.
- Keep all **payment confirmations** -- they are required attachments for permit applications.
- Fees are generally **non-refundable** even if the application is denied (with limited exceptions).
- Check for **municipal fee reductions** -- some local governments offer reduced utility connection fees for energy-efficient buildings or developments in designated growth areas.
