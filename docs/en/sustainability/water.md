# Water Management

Water management in building projects covers two objectives: **managing rainwater on site** (retention, infiltration, controlled discharge) and **reducing potable water consumption** (efficient fixtures, rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling). Polish regulations increasingly require both, and proper documentation is essential for building permits.

## Rainwater Retention Requirements

### Polish Regulatory Framework

The key regulations governing rainwater management:

- **Prawo wodne (Water Law)** — requires management of rainwater on the plot; discharge to municipal sewers may require a permit and fees.
- **Warunki Techniczne ([WT 2021](/en/regulations/wt-2021))** — sets requirements for site drainage and the proportion of biologically active surface.
- **Local zoning plans (MPZP)** — often define minimum permeable surface ratios and maximum impervious coverage.
- **Prawo budowlane** — building permit applications must address stormwater management.

::: warning
Since 2018, discharging rainwater into combined sewers incurs fees calculated per cubic metre. On-site retention is now an economic necessity, not just a regulatory one. Check local tariffs when calculating project costs.
:::

### Local Requirements

Beyond national regulations, municipalities may impose additional requirements:

- Minimum retention volumes per hectare of impervious surface
- Maximum discharge rates to the public sewer network
- Mandatory infiltration where soil conditions permit
- Green roof requirements for buildings over a certain footprint

Always check the local development plan (MPZP) and consult the local water authority early in the [concept phase](/en/phases/concept). Document local requirements alongside national ones in the project brief.

### Biologically Active Surface (Powierzchnia Biologicznie Czynna)

The biologically active surface ratio is a key planning parameter in Poland. It defines the minimum percentage of the plot that must remain permeable and support vegetation.

| Source | Typical Requirement |
|---|---|
| Local zoning plan (MPZP) | 25-50% of plot area (varies by zone) |
| WT 2021 general rule | Sufficient to manage rainwater on site |
| Urban dense areas | 20-30% minimum |
| Suburban residential | 40-60% minimum |

::: info
Semi-permeable surfaces (permeable pavers, gravel, green roofs) can count partially toward the biologically active surface requirement. Green roofs with >= 20 cm substrate typically count at 50-80% effectiveness. Check local interpretation with the planning authority.
:::

### Retention Sizing

Calculate required retention volume based on:

1. **Plot area** and percentage of impervious surfaces
2. **Design rainfall intensity** — typically 15-minute storm with 5-year return period for residential, 10-year for commercial
3. **Permitted discharge rate** — set by the water authority or sewer operator
4. **Soil infiltration capacity** — determined by geotechnical survey

Basic retention formula:

**V = (A x q x t x phi) - (Q_out x t)**

Where: V = retention volume (m3), A = catchment area (m2), q = rainfall intensity (l/s/m2), t = storm duration (s), phi = runoff coefficient, Q_out = permitted discharge rate (m3/s).

## Stormwater Management Strategies

### Permeable Surfaces

| Surface Type | Infiltration Rate | Runoff Coefficient (phi) | Cost Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Natural grass / soil | 10-50 mm/h | 0.10 - 0.20 | Low |
| Gravel / crushed stone | 30-100 mm/h | 0.05 - 0.15 | Low |
| Permeable pavers | 20-80 mm/h | 0.20 - 0.40 | Medium |
| Porous asphalt | 15-40 mm/h | 0.30 - 0.50 | Medium-High |
| Green roof (extensive) | 5-15 mm/h | 0.40 - 0.60 | High |
| Green roof (intensive) | 10-30 mm/h | 0.20 - 0.40 | Very High |
| Standard asphalt / concrete | 0 mm/h | 0.85 - 0.95 | Reference |

### Retention Tanks

Underground or above-ground tanks that store rainwater and release it at a controlled rate:

- **Underground concrete/PE tanks** — suitable for parking areas and constrained sites
- **Modular crate systems** — lightweight, easy to install, good infiltration capacity
- **Above-ground tanks** — lower cost, suitable for gardens and landscape areas
- **Sizing** — based on retention formula above; oversizing by 10-15% is recommended for climate uncertainty

### Green Roofs

| Parameter | Extensive | Semi-Intensive | Intensive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Substrate depth | 60-150 mm | 150-300 mm | > 300 mm |
| Weight (saturated) | 60-150 kg/m2 | 150-300 kg/m2 | > 300 kg/m2 |
| Water retention | 30-50% annual | 40-60% annual | 50-80% annual |
| Maintenance | Low (2x/year) | Medium (4x/year) | High (regular) |
| Structural impact | Minimal | Moderate | Significant |

::: tip
Green roofs also contribute to thermal performance (reducing cooling loads), extend roof membrane lifespan, and improve biodiversity. Document these co-benefits in your sustainability report and reference them in your energy calculations. See [Energy & Carbon](./energy-carbon) for thermal implications.
:::

### Rain Gardens and Bioswales

- Shallow planted depressions that collect and infiltrate runoff
- Suitable for parking areas, roadside edges, and residential gardens
- Typical depth: 150-300 mm ponding, 300-600 mm filter substrate
- Planting: native species tolerant of periodic flooding and drought
- Document in the landscape plan with drainage zone references

## Water Efficiency

### Water-Efficient Fixtures

Specify fixtures that reduce potable water consumption without compromising user comfort:

| Fixture | Standard Flow/Flush | Efficient Specification | Water Saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| WC — dual flush | 6 / 9 litres | 3 / 4.5 litres | 40-50% |
| Basin tap | 12 l/min | 5 l/min (aerated) | 55-60% |
| Kitchen tap | 12 l/min | 7 l/min (aerated) | 40% |
| Shower head | 12 l/min | 7-8 l/min | 35-40% |
| Urinal | 3 litres/flush | 1 litre or waterless | 65-100% |

### Rainwater Harvesting

Collected rainwater can replace potable water for non-drinking uses:

| Use | Typical Demand | Quality Required |
|---|---|---|
| Toilet flushing | 30-40 l/person/day | Basic filtration + disinfection |
| Garden irrigation | Seasonal, varies | Filtration only |
| Car washing | Occasional | Basic filtration |
| Laundry | 15-25 l/person/day | Filtration + UV treatment |
| Cooling tower make-up | System-dependent | Filtration + treatment |

Harvesting system components:

1. **Collection surface** — roof area (exclude areas with lead flashing or bitumen)
2. **Pre-filtration** — leaf screens, first-flush diverters
3. **Storage tank** — underground or above-ground; size based on demand and rainfall
4. **Pump and controls** — pressure set with automatic mains backup
5. **Treatment** — filtration and, for indoor use, UV disinfection
6. **Distribution** — separate pipework clearly labelled "non-potable"

::: warning
Rainwater distribution pipes must be completely separate from potable water supply and clearly marked. Polish sanitary regulations prohibit any cross-connection between potable and non-potable systems. Document the separation in your installation drawings and include it in the [construction documents](/en/phases/construction-docs).
:::

## Greywater Recycling

Greywater (from showers, basins, and baths — excluding toilets and kitchen sinks) can be treated and reused for toilet flushing and irrigation. Greywater recycling is most practical in larger buildings with high and consistent water use.

| Parameter | Typical Value |
|---|---|
| Greywater generation | 50-80 l/person/day |
| Recovery rate after treatment | 70-85% |
| Suitable reuse | Toilet flushing, irrigation |
| Treatment required | Filtration, biological treatment, disinfection |
| Payback period | 8-15 years (residential), 5-8 years (commercial) |

::: info
Greywater recycling is most cost-effective in large residential developments, hotels, and sports facilities where generation and reuse volumes are high. For single-family homes, rainwater harvesting is usually more practical. Document the cost-benefit analysis in the project brief.
:::

### When to Consider Greywater Recycling

- Multi-family residential above 50 units
- Hotels and hospitality with high shower usage
- Sports facilities with showers and irrigation needs
- Office buildings above 5,000 m2 with canteen facilities
- Where water supply costs are high or supply is constrained

## How Water Management Maps to Documentation

::: tip
Link your water management documentation to the [concept phase](/en/phases/concept) site analysis and the [design development](/en/phases/design-development) landscape design. Water strategy decisions made early have the greatest impact on site layout and building positioning. For integrating water monitoring data into your building model, see [BIM Integration](/en/bim-integration/) and [Sensors & IoT](/en/bim-integration/sensors-iot).
