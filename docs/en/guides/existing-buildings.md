# Documenting Existing Buildings

This guide explains how to apply the documentation standard when surveying and recording existing buildings. Whether you are working on a renovation, adaptive reuse, heritage conservation, or facility management project, the standard provides a consistent framework for capturing as-built conditions.

## When to Use This Guide

This guide applies whenever you need to document a building that already exists:

- **Renovation and modernization** -- upgrading systems, finishes, or spatial layouts
- **Adaptive reuse** -- converting a building to a new function (e.g., warehouse to offices)
- **Heritage and conservation** -- recording historic fabric and planning interventions
- **Facility management** -- creating a baseline record for ongoing operations
- **Due diligence** -- pre-purchase surveys and condition assessments

::: info Key Difference from New Projects
For existing buildings, you start with the [As-Built Phase (Phase 7)](/en/phases/as-built) rather than Phase 1. You are recording what exists before planning what will change.

## Survey Workflow

Follow this three-stage workflow to capture existing conditions systematically.

### Stage 1: Measure

1. Obtain any available existing documentation (original drawings, permits, previous surveys).
2. Conduct a measured survey of the building, floor by floor.
3. Record structural grid lines, wall thicknesses, floor-to-floor heights, and opening dimensions.
4. Use laser scanning or photogrammetry for complex geometries or heritage buildings.
5. Note discrepancies between existing documents and measured reality.

### Stage 2: Photograph

1. Photograph every room from at least two opposing corners.
2. Capture all facades, roof conditions, and site context.
3. Document visible defects: cracks, damp, material degradation.
4. Photograph concealed elements when access is available (above ceilings, below floors, within risers).
5. Use a consistent naming convention linking photos to rooms and locations.

### Stage 3: Document

1. Produce as-built drawings from survey data.
2. Create the documentation cards described below.
3. Record uncertainties and areas requiring further investigation.
4. Compile a survey report summarizing findings and data quality.

## Creating Documentation Cards from Survey Data

### Building Card

Create the Building card first. Populate it with:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Address and coordinates | Site visit, maps |
| Construction date | Title deeds, building log book, archives |
| Structural system | Visual inspection, original drawings |
| Number of storeys | Measured survey |
| Gross floor area | Measured survey |
| Current use class | On-site observation, permits |
| Condition rating | Survey assessment |

### Level Cards

Create one Level card for each storey, including basements and roof levels where accessible:

1. Assign a clear identifier (e.g., Level -1, Level 00, Level 01).
2. Record floor-to-floor height and finished floor level relative to a datum.
3. Note the structural system and floor construction type.
4. Attach the corresponding floor plan drawing.

### Space Cards

Create a Space card for every surveyed room or functional area:

1. Assign a unique space number consistent with your naming convention.
2. Record measured dimensions: length, width, area, clear height.
3. Document current function and finishes (floor, wall, ceiling).
4. Note any non-standard conditions (sloping floors, irregular geometry, load restrictions).

### System and Asset Cards

Document the building's technical systems and significant equipment:

1. **System cards**: HVAC, electrical distribution, plumbing, fire protection, vertical transport.
2. **Asset cards**: boilers, chillers, air handling units, switchgear, lifts -- any equipment that requires maintenance or has replacement value.
3. Record manufacturer, model, age (if known), condition, and capacity.

Refer to the [Operations section](/en/operations/) for asset management workflows.

## Information Capture Reference

Use this table to determine what information to capture for each card type during an existing building survey.

| Card Type | Required Information | Typical Sources |
|---|---|---|
| Building | Address, date, structure, area, storeys, condition | Deeds, archives, survey |
| Level | Height, datum, floor type, structural system | Measured survey |
| Space | Dimensions, function, finishes, condition | Measured survey, photos |
| System | Type, age, capacity, condition, compliance | Inspection, nameplate data |
| Asset | Make, model, serial number, install date, condition | Nameplate, maintenance logs |

## Common Challenges

::: warning Incomplete Information
Existing buildings rarely come with complete documentation. Be explicit about what is known, assumed, and unknown. Use a confidence rating (high / medium / low) on each card to communicate data reliability.
:::

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|
| Missing original drawings | Conduct a full measured survey; check municipal archives |
| Hidden construction | Open up inspection panels; use non-destructive testing (GPR, thermography) |
| Undocumented alterations | Compare survey data against available permits; interview building users |
| Hazardous materials | Commission specialist surveys (asbestos, lead) before intrusive investigation |
| Incomplete service records | Record visible equipment; flag gaps for further investigation |
