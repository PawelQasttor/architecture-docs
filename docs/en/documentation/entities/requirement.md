# Requirement (Rules & Regulations)

## What This Is

A **Requirement** file documents one rule that your building must follow. Examples: "Bedroom ceiling height must be >= 2.50m" (WT 2021), "Living room needs minimum 2% daylight factor" (EN 17037).

::: tip For Architects
**Problem:** Inspector asks "Does this bedroom meet WT 2021 §132 height requirement?"

**Old way:** Hunt through specifications, hope you documented it, manually check if 2.70m >= 2.50m.

**With requirements:** The system automatically checks every bedroom against `REQ-PL-WT-ROOM-HEIGHT-001` and tells you pass/fail. **No manual checking.**

**One requirement file = automatic compliance checking for every relevant room.**
:::

A **Requirement** defines a performance, regulatory, or design rule that documents must satisfy. Requirements drive compliance checking, verification planning, and digital twin runtime monitoring.

## Purpose

Requirements specify:
- Performance targets (daylight factor, thermal comfort, acoustic insulation)
- Regulatory compliance (WT 2021, Prawo budowlane, EN standards)
- Dimensional constraints (room heights, corridor widths)
- System performance (ventilation rates, fire resistance)
- Verification methods and responsibilities

## Choosing Between Numeric and Qualitative Requirements

::: warning Critical Decision
SBM supports **two types** of requirements. Choose ONE approach per requirement — **never mix both in the same requirement**.
:::

### Decision Tree

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Can you express this requirement as:        │
│ [metric] [operator] [value]?                │
│                                             │
│ Example: height >= 2.50 m                  │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
               │
       ┌───────┴───────┐
       │               │
     YES              NO
       │               │
       ▼               ▼
  NUMERIC        QUALITATIVE
```

### Use NUMERIC Requirements When...

✅ **You have a measurable quantity and threshold**

| Question | Answer | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| Is there a number? | Yes (2.50 m, 60 dB, 21°C, 2%) | Numeric |
| Is there a comparison? | Yes (>=, <=, ==, range) | Numeric |
| Can software auto-check it? | Yes (compare values) | Numeric |

**Examples:**
- ✅ Room height >= 2.50 m
- ✅ Daylight factor >= 2%
- ✅ Temperature range: 20-26°C
- ✅ Acoustic insulation >= 60 dB
- ✅ Fire resistance >= REI 60

**How to write:**
```yaml
requirementType: "dimensional"  # or performance, regulatory, safety
metric: "height"
operator: ">="
value: 2.5
unit: "m"
```

### Use QUALITATIVE Requirements When...

✅ **The requirement is procedural, conceptual, or non-numeric**

| Question | Answer | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| Is it a process or procedure? | Yes (clean/dirty separation) | Qualitative |
| Is it a spatial concept? | Yes (no line of sight between X and Y) | Qualitative |
| Is it a material constraint? | Yes (must use antimicrobial finishes) | Qualitative |
| Can you measure it with numbers? | No (it's a yes/no or checklist) | Qualitative |

**Examples:**
- ✅ Clean and dirty flows must not cross
- ✅ Operating room must have no line of sight to public areas
- ✅ All surfaces must be antimicrobial
- ✅ Wheelchair accessible path required
- ✅ Airlock required between zones

**How to write:**
```yaml
requirementType: "qualitative"
qualitativeDescription: "Clean and dirty material flows must not cross"
acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Separate corridors for clean and dirty transport"
  - "Airlock between clean and dirty zones"
evidenceRequired:
  - "Floor plan with clean/dirty flow arrows"
  - "Operational procedure document"
```

---

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Mixing Both Types (DON'T DO THIS)**

```yaml
# WRONG - Don't use both metric AND qualitative
metric: "height"
operator: ">="
value: 2.5
qualitativeDescription: "Room must feel spacious"  # ← NO! Choose one approach
```

❌ **Using Qualitative for Measurable Values**

```yaml
# WRONG - This is measurable, use numeric instead
qualitativeDescription: "Room should be at least 2.50 meters tall"

# RIGHT - Use numeric
metric: "height"
operator: ">="
value: 2.5
unit: "m"
```

❌ **Using Numeric for Non-Measurable Concepts**

```yaml
# WRONG - "clean/dirty separation" isn't a number
metric: "clean_dirty_separation"
operator: "=="
value: 1  # ← What does "1" mean here?

# RIGHT - Use qualitative
qualitativeDescription: "Clean and dirty flows must not cross"
acceptanceCriteria: [...]
```

---

### Split Complex Requirements

If a requirement has **both numeric and conceptual parts**, split it into **two separate requirements**:

**Example: Accessible bedroom**

❌ **Wrong (mixed):**
```yaml
id: "REQ-ACCESSIBLE-BEDROOM"
metric: "clear_width"
operator: ">="
value: 0.90
qualitativeDescription: "Must allow wheelchair turning circle"  # ← Mixed!
```

✅ **Right (split into two):**

```yaml
# REQ-ACCESSIBLE-BEDROOM-WIDTH
id: "REQ-ACCESSIBLE-BEDROOM-WIDTH"
requirementName: "Accessible bedroom door width"
requirementType: "dimensional"
metric: "clear_width"
operator: ">="
value: 0.90
unit: "m"
```

```yaml
# REQ-ACCESSIBLE-BEDROOM-TURNING
id: "REQ-ACCESSIBLE-BEDROOM-TURNING"
requirementName: "Accessible bedroom turning circle"
requirementType: "qualitative"
qualitativeDescription: "Must allow 1.50m wheelchair turning circle"
acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Clear floor space of 1.50m diameter"
  - "No obstructions within turning circle"
```

---

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | string | Unique requirement identifier | `"REQ-DAYLIGHT-SLEEPING-001"` |
| `entityType` | string | Must be `"requirement"` | `"requirement"` |
| `documentType` | string | Must be `"requirement"` | `"requirement"` |
| `requirementName` | string | Human-readable name | `"Minimum daylight factor for sleeping spaces"` |
| `requirementType` | string | Type (see enum below) | `"performance"` |
| `version` | string | Semantic version | `"1.0.0"` |

### Conditional Fields (Numeric Requirements)

These fields are **required for numeric requirements** but **optional since v0.3.0** (not needed for qualitative requirements):

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `metric` | string | Measurable metric | `"daylight_factor"` |
| `operator` | string | Comparison operator | `">="`, `"<="`, `"=="`, `"range"` |
| `value` | number/object | Target value or range | `2.0` or `{ "min": 20, "max": 26 }` |
| `unit` | string | Measurement unit | `"%"`, `"m"`, `"dB"`, `"°C"` |

### Qualitative Requirement Fields (v0.3.0)

For non-numeric requirements (e.g., procedural rules, separation concepts), use these instead of metric/operator/value:

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `qualitativeDescription` | string | Plain-text description of the requirement | `"Clean and dirty flows must not cross"` |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | array of strings | Specific criteria that must be met | `["Separate corridors for clean/dirty", ...]` |
| `evidenceRequired` | array of strings | Evidence needed for verification | `["Floor plan with flow arrows", ...]` |

::: tip For Architects: What These Required Fields Mean
- **id**: Requirement identifier (e.g., `REQ-PL-WT-ROOM-HEIGHT-001`)
- **requirementName**: Plain English description ("Minimum room height per WT 2021")
- **requirementType**: Category -- `performance`, `dimensional`, `regulatory`, `safety`, `qualitative` (new in v0.3.0)
- **metric**: What you're measuring (e.g., `height`, `daylight_factor`, `fire_resistance`). **Optional since v0.3.0** -- omit for qualitative requirements.
- **operator**: How to compare -- `>=` (greater than or equal), `<=` (less than or equal), `==` (equals), `range` (between min and max). **Optional since v0.3.0**.
- **value**: Target value (e.g., `2.5` for 2.50m) or range (e.g., `{min: 20, max: 26}` for temperature). **Optional since v0.3.0**.
- **unit**: What unit (e.g., `"m"` for meters, `"%"` for percentage, `"°C"` for Celsius). **Optional since v0.3.0**.

**Example (numeric):** Room height >= 2.50m becomes:
```yaml
metric: "height"
operator: ">="
value: 2.5
unit: "m"
```

**Example (qualitative):** Clean/dirty separation becomes:
```yaml
requirementType: "qualitative"
qualitativeDescription: "Clean and dirty material flows must not cross"
acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Separate corridors for clean and dirty transport"
  - "Airlock between clean and dirty zones"
evidenceRequired:
  - "Floor plan with clean/dirty flow arrows"
  - "Operational procedure document"
```
:::

## Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `countryScope` | string | "global" or "poland_specific", etc. |
| `scope` | object | Applicability scope (document types, space types) |
| `verification` | object | Verification method, tools, phase, responsible party |
| `legalBasis` | array | Legal references (regulation, section, article) |
| `technicalBasis` | array | Technical standard references (EN, ISO, ASHRAE) |
| `description` | string | Detailed explanation |
| `tags` | array | Free-form classification tags |

::: tip For Architects: Which Optional Fields Matter Most?

**For permit compliance:**
- **legalBasis** — Which law/regulation (e.g., WT 2021 §132, Prawo Budowlane Art. 5)
- **scope** — Which rooms this applies to (e.g., only bedrooms, only residential spaces)
- **description** — Plain explanation for inspectors

**For design verification:**
- **verification** — How to check this (simulation, calculation, inspection)
- **technicalBasis** — Which technical standard (e.g., EN 17037, ISO 140-4)

**For compliance reports:**
- **countryScope** — "poland_specific" (loads only for Polish projects) or "global" (always loads)

**Most common:** Just add `legalBasis` and `scope`. The system handles the rest.
:::

## Requirement Types (Enum)

```typescript
type RequirementType =
  | "performance"     // Functional performance targets
  | "dimensional"     // Size, height, width constraints
  | "regulatory"      // Legal compliance requirements
  | "design"          // Design standards and guidelines
  | "operational"     // Runtime operational requirements
  | "safety"          // Health and safety requirements
  | "sustainability"  // Environmental performance targets
  | "qualitative";    // Non-numeric, descriptive requirements (v0.3.0)
```

## Example: Qualitative Requirement (v0.3.0)

**For requirements that cannot be expressed as metric >= value**, use the qualitative type. This is common in healthcare (clean/dirty separation), infection control, and operational procedures.

## Scope Definition

Requirements use `scope` to define applicability:

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "entityType": "space",
    "spaceTypes": ["sleeping_space", "bedroom"],
    "conditions": {
      "buildingType": "residential",
      "occupancyCategory": "R-2"
    }
  }
}
```

**Scope matching logic:**
- `entityType`: Which document type this requirement applies to
- `spaceTypes`: Specific space types (for space requirements)
- `zoneTypes`: Specific zone types (for zone requirements)
- `conditions`: Additional filters (building type, occupancy, etc.)

## Verification Methods

Requirements specify how to verify compliance:

| Method | Description | Typical Phase | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `simulation` | Computational analysis | Schematic, DD | Daylight simulation |
| `calculation` | Formula-based computation | DD, CD | U-value calculation |
| `measurement` | Physical measurement | As-built, operation | Room height measurement |
| `testing` | Laboratory/field testing | Construction | Acoustic testing |
| `certification` | Third-party certification | Construction | Fire door certification |
| `inspection` | Visual inspection | As-built | Installation verification |
| `monitoring` | Continuous sensor data | Operation | Temperature monitoring |

## Operators and Values

### Simple Comparison

```json
{
  "metric": "room_height_clear",
  "operator": ">=",
  "value": 2.50,
  "unit": "m"
}
```

### Range

```json
{
  "metric": "operative_temperature",
  "operator": "range",
  "value": { "min": 20, "max": 26 },
  "unit": "°C"
}
```

### Equality

```json
{
  "metric": "fire_resistance_rating",
  "operator": "==",
  "value": "REI 60",
  "unit": null
}
```

## Compliance Checking

The compiler evaluates requirements against documents:

```json
{
  "spaceComplianceDetails": [
    {
      "requirementId": "REQ-PL-WT-ROOM-HEIGHT-001",
      "spaceId": "SP-BLD-01-L01-001",
      "spaceName": "Bedroom 01",
      "metric": "room_height_clear",
      "targetValue": 2.50,
      "measuredValue": 2.70,
      "operator": ">=",
      "status": "compliant",
      "margin": 0.20,
      "unit": "m"
    },
    {
      "requirementId": "REQ-DAYLIGHT-SLEEPING-001",
      "spaceId": "SP-BLD-01-L01-001",
      "spaceName": "Bedroom 01",
      "metric": "daylight_factor",
      "targetValue": 2.0,
      "measuredValue": null,
      "operator": ">=",
      "status": "pending_verification",
      "verificationMethod": "simulation",
      "unit": "%"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Jurisdiction Packs

Requirements are organized into jurisdiction packs:

```
scripts/requirements/
├── global/                    # International standards (always loaded)
│   ├── req-daylight-sleeping-001.json
│   ├── req-acoustic-sleeping-001.json
│   ├── req-thermal-comfort-001.json
│   └── req-ventilation-occupied-001.json
│
├── pl/                        # Poland-specific (loaded when country = "PL")
│   ├── req-pl-wt-room-height-001.json
│   ├── req-pl-wt-corridor-width-001.json
│   ├── req-pl-fire-separation-001.json
│   └── req-pl-thermal-walls-001.json
│
├── de/                        # Germany (future)
│   └── req-de-enev-...json
│
└── gb/                        # UK (future)
    └── req-gb-building-regs-...json
```

**Auto-loading logic:**
```javascript
// Global requirements always loaded
const globalReqs = await loadRequirements('global');

// Country-specific requirements loaded based on project.country
if (project.country === 'PL') {
  const plReqs = await loadRequirements('pl');
  allRequirements = [...globalReqs, ...plReqs];
}
```

## Compliance Report Integration

Requirements populate the compliance report with regulatory sections:

```json
{
  "polandSpecificCompliance": {
    "regulation": "WT_2021",
    "sections": [
      {
        "section": "§ 132",
        "description": "Wysokość pomieszczeń",
        "requirements": [
          {
            "id": "REQ-PL-WT-ROOM-HEIGHT-001",
            "status": "verified",
            "affectedSpaces": 54,
            "verifiedSpaces": 54,
            "failedSpaces": 0
          }
        ],
        "status": "compliant"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Digital Twin Runtime Evaluation

Requirements with `monitoring` verification generate runtime rules:

```json
{
  "runtimeEvaluationRules": [
    {
      "requirementId": "REQ-THERMAL-COMFORT-001",
      "metric": "operative_temperature",
      "operator": "range",
      "targetRange": { "min": 20, "max": 26 },
      "unit": "°C",
      "evaluationFrequency": "5min",
      "applicableSpaces": [
        {
          "spaceId": "SP-BLD-01-L01-001",
          "sensorId": "TEMP-SP-BLD-01-L01-001",
          "dataPoint": "AI-SP-BLD-01-L01-001-TEMP"
        }
      ],
      "alertThresholds": {
        "warning": { "min": 18, "max": 28 },
        "critical": { "min": 16, "max": 30 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Requirement Sources (Dual Format)

Requirements exist in **two formats by design**, each serving a different purpose:

| Format | Location | Purpose | Who Authors |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **JSON files** | `scripts/requirements/{country}/` | Jurisdiction templates shared across all projects | Standard maintainers |
| **Markdown files** | `{project}/requirements/` | Project-specific requirements authored by the design team | Architects, engineers |

**JSON (jurisdiction templates)** are reusable rule packs loaded automatically by the compiler based on the project's country code. They encode building codes (WT 2021, DIN, Building Regs) as machine-readable rules with scope matching -- the compiler auto-assigns them to spaces by `spaceType`. You do not need to reference them manually from each space file.

**Markdown (project instances)** are project-specific requirements written alongside your other entity files. They follow the same YAML frontmatter format as all other SBM entities and can contain narrative documentation in the Markdown body. Use these for client-specific rules, design targets, or custom requirements that go beyond code minimums.

Both formats produce identical requirement entities in the compiled `sbm.json` -- the distinction is purely about authoring workflow and reusability.

## Authoring Requirements

### Global Requirements (JSON)
Place in `scripts/requirements/global/` - automatically loaded for all projects.

### Country-Specific Requirements (JSON)
Place in `scripts/requirements/{country_code}/` - loaded when `project.country` matches.

### Project-Specific Requirements (Markdown)
Place in `{project}/requirements/` - loaded for that project only.
