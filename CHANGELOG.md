## [tooling 2.7.0] - 2026-05-30 — Query layer + semantic model-diff

Tooling-only — **spec unchanged** (`sbm_version` stays `"2.5"`, 35 entity types). Adds two
deterministic, offline ways to *interrogate* the compiled model, building on the v2.5
knowledge graph and v2.6 `revisionHistory`: a **query DSL** ("what is X / what connects to X
/ which entities match Y") and a **semantic diff** ("what changed between two snapshots").
No LLM, no network — these are the substrate an external agent or a human uses.

### Added

- **`query` CLI command + `scripts/compiler/query.mjs`** — a small parser-free DSL over a
  compiled `sbm.json`: `list <type> [where <path> <op> <value>]`, `count …`, `get <id>`,
  `neighbors <id> [<relType>] [in|out]`. Ops `= != > < >= <= contains exists`; dotted paths
  (`cost.totalCost`) via a new `getByPath`. Attribute filters run over entities; relationship
  traversal reuses the knowledge graph. `--format text|json`.
  - e.g. `query --input build/green-terrace "list spaces where designArea > 14"`,
    `query --input build/green-terrace "neighbors SP-BLD-01-L01-001 must_satisfy out"`.
- **`diff` CLI command + `scripts/compiler/model-diff.mjs`** — entity- and relationship-aware
  diff of two compiled snapshots: entities added/removed/changed (field paths with from→to,
  derived keys denylisted), edges added/removed (via the knowledge graph), and entity-type
  count deltas. `--from`/`--to` (file or build dir), `--output` writes `model_diff.json`,
  `--format text|json`. Complements `revisionHistory` (narrative) by computing the actual delta.
- **18 unit tests** (`tests/query.test.mjs` + `tests/model-diff.test.mjs`).
- npm convenience scripts `sbm:query` and `sbm:diff`.

### Changed

- Compiler `VERSION` 2.6.0 → 2.7.0; `package.json` + lockfile → 2.7.0. `sbm_version` stays "2.5".
- `index.mjs`: `parseArgs` gains `--query`/`--from`/`--to`/`--format` + a trailing-positional
  query; `main()` gains `query` + `diff` command branches + a `loadSbm` helper; help extended.
- Tests: **168/168 pass** (was 150).

### Significance

The compiled model is now directly **queryable and diffable** without reading raw JSON or
understanding the compiler internals — and both run offline. This is the deterministic
substrate that an LLM/MCP front-end (a deliberate future step) would sit on top of.

## [2.5.0-spec / tooling 2.6.0] - 2026-05-29 — Temporal versioning + design-options

Adds the two axes the model still couldn't express, both from `SBM-EVALUATION-v1.1.md`:
**temporal versioning** (#10 — in-model revision audit trail) and **design-option
comparison** (#18 — alternatives, "Scheme A vs B", with per-option rollups). Genuine spec
bump: `sbm_version` → **"2.5"** (new `schemas/sbm-schema-v2.5.json`), **35 entity types**;
tooling (`package.json` + compiler `VERSION`) → **2.6.0** (tooling-ahead-of-spec offset).
Additive — every v2.4 model stays valid.

> Note: this entry supersedes the earlier same-day "2.5.0 knowledge-graph" tooling entry
> below; the knowledge-graph target shipped as tooling 2.5.0 with the spec still at 2.4. The
> spec only now advances to 2.5 with this release.

### Added

- **New `design_option` entity type (35th)** — ID `^OPT-…$`. Describes one explored scheme
  (`optionName`, `status` under_consideration/selected/rejected/superseded, `rationale`,
  `decisionOwner`, `decisionDate`, `supersededByOptionId`, and headline `comparison`
  metrics: gfa/unitCount/capexEur/embodiedCarbon/operationalCarbon).
- **Two cross-cutting axes on every entity** (optional): temporal — `revision` (int) +
  `revisionHistory` (array, reusing the long-dormant `revisionEntry` `$def`); design-options
  — `designOptionId` (`^OPT-…$`) + `variantOf` (links a variant to its baseline/sibling).
- **New `option-comparison` target** (`scripts/compiler/targets/option-comparison.mjs`)
  → `option_comparison.json`: per-option rollups (baseline + that option's tagged entities)
  of cost/area/embodied-carbon, a side-by-side `comparison` matrix with deltas vs the
  selected option, and the `selected` option flagged. Skipped when no design_options.
- **Green Terrace examples (EN+PL)**: `OPT-SCHEME-A` (selected, 16 m² bedrooms) +
  `OPT-SCHEME-B` (rejected, 12 m², `supersededByOptionId` A) with representative variant
  spaces (`SP-OPTA-BED-01` / `SP-OPTB-BED-01` linked by `variantOf`); `revisionHistory`
  added to bedroom-01 / sypialnia-01 showing a 3-revision audit trail.

### Changed

- `sbm_version` "2.4" → "2.5"; schema const + compiler output. Compiler `VERSION` 2.5.0 →
  2.6.0; `package.json` + lockfile → 2.6.0.
- New `V2_5_ENTITY_TYPES` set; `ALL_ENTITY_TYPES` + parse `validTypes` extended; normalize
  buckets/mapping/output/metadata for `design_options`.
- **Double-count guard**: `performCostRollup` + area/carbon/space-program aggregations skip
  any entity carrying a `designOptionId` — baseline totals are unchanged by adding variants
  (verified: green-terrace baseline stays 4 spaces / 43.9 m²). Per-option totals live only
  in `option_comparison.json`.
- Validate: `designOptionId` must reference an existing design_option (error); `variantOf` /
  `supersededByOptionId` dangling refs (warning); warning when ≠1 option is `selected`.
- Quality: `design_option` profile. Knowledge-graph: `in_option` / `variant_of` /
  `superseded_by` edge verbs (design_option nodes + edges surface automatically).
- index.mjs now generates **8 compile targets (7 JSON + HTML)**.
- Tests: **150/150 pass** (was 138) — design_option block, temporal/option cross-cutting
  tests, new `option-comparison.test.mjs`, knowledge-graph option-edge test.

### Migration

- Bump `sbm_version` to `"2.5"`. No other changes required — additive. `revision`/
  `revisionHistory`/`designOptionId`/`variantOf` are all optional.

### Significance

SBM can now express **how a design evolves** (revision trail) and **what alternatives were
weighed** (design options with compiler-computed per-option cost/area/carbon) — the two
early-design dimensions the evaluation flagged as missing. Both are queryable in the
knowledge graph.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-29 — Knowledge-graph export target (AI-ready linked-data projection)

Tooling-only release — **the spec is unchanged** (`sbm_version` stays `"2.4"`,
34 entity types). Adds an 8th compile target that projects the whole compiled
model as a **linked-data knowledge graph**: typed nodes (one per entity) + typed
edges (derived from the relationships the normalize stage already resolves),
plus a JSON-LD `@graph`. This is the shape graph databases, RAG pipelines, and
LLM tooling consume best, directly serving the standard's "AI-ready" mission.
Because it is a read-only projection, **every existing v2.0–v2.4 model gets a
graph for free** — no migration.

### Added

- **New `knowledge-graph` target** (`scripts/compiler/targets/knowledge-graph.mjs`)
  → `knowledge_graph.json` per example. Output: `nodes[]` (id, type, label,
  phase, completeness), `edges[]` (from, to, type, optional subtype), a
  `summary` (counts by node/edge type), and a `jsonld` block (`@context` +
  `@graph` with outgoing edges grouped per node).
- **Controlled edge vocabulary** (~23 relationship verbs) derived from entity
  fields: `part_of`, `contains`, `in_zone`, `instance_of`, `must_satisfy`,
  `adjacent_to`, `served_by_system`, `subsystem_of`, `in_package`, `measures`,
  `blocked_by`, `depends_on_permit`, `delivers`, `triggered_by`, … Edges are
  only emitted when the target id resolves to a real node (no dangling edges).
- **8 unit tests** (`tests/knowledge-graph.test.mjs`): node/edge generation,
  dangling-edge prevention, `_meta`-field skipping, summary integrity, JSON-LD shape.

### Changed

- Compiler `VERSION` 2.4.0 → 2.5.0; `package.json` + lockfile → 2.5.0.
  `sbm_version` output stays `"2.4"` (spec unchanged; tooling-ahead-of-spec, as
  with the v2.1.0 release).
- `index.mjs` now generates **7 compile targets (6 JSON + HTML report)**;
  graph emitted as `knowledge_graph.json`.
- Tests: **138/138 pass** (was 130).

### Significance

The SBM compiler can now hand an LLM or graph store the entire building model as
a navigable graph — "what connects to what" across spaces, systems, zones,
requirements, permits, gates, and inspections — without the consumer needing to
understand the Markdown/frontmatter source or the compiler internals.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-29 — Delivery & approval process layer: permit + approval_gate + regulatory_inspection

Opens the **"how the building gets BUILT"** dimension that the original
`SBM-EVALUATION-v1.1.md` named as the model's #1 remaining weakness. Where
v2.2/v2.3 modelled *how the building performs* (operational analytics), v2.4
models the **regulatory delivery & approval process** — permits, phase-gate
milestones, and statutory inspections — grounded in the Polish building-delivery
research (`docs/deep-research-report.md`). Additive only — every v2.3-conforming
model is also v2.4-conforming. Brings the standard to **34 entity types**.

### Added

- **New `permit` entity type (32nd).** Regulatory authorizations / administrative
  decisions: `permitType` covers zoning_decision (WZ), local_plan_extract (MPZP),
  environmental_decision, building_permit, notification (zgłoszenie),
  demolition_permit, occupancy_permit, completion_notice, heritage_approval,
  utility_connection_conditions. Carries an inline `issuingAuthority` (typed
  authority enum incl. PINB/WINB/conservator), `status` lifecycle (incl.
  `silent_consent` for the silence-rule routes), `statutoryDeadlineDays`, decision
  dates, `conditions[]`, fee, and supersession/appeal chain. ID `^PERMIT-...$`.
- **New `approval_gate` entity type (33rd).** Phase-gate go/no-go milestones
  (design_freeze, permit_ready, construction_start, completion_authorized,
  operational_readiness, …) with `decisionOwner`, a `prerequisites[]` checklist,
  `deliverableRefs`, `blockingIssueIds`, and `relatedPermitIds`. ID `^GATE-...$`.
- **New `regulatory_inspection` entity type (34th).** Statutory periodic
  inspections (annual / 5-year per Prawo Budowlane Art. 62, plus chimney/gas/
  electrical/fire/lift) with `statutoryBasis`, schedule, inspector, result +
  deficiencies, and a `cKobEntry` link to the digital building logbook (c-KOB —
  Cyfrowa Książka Obiektu Budowlanego). ID `^INSP-...$`.
- **`schemas/sbm-schema-v2.4.json`** — new schema file (v2.0 / v2.2 / v2.3 stay
  frozen for reference).
- **10 v2.4 entities demonstrated across all 3 sibling examples (EN + PL):**
  green-terrace — `PERMIT-WZ-001`, `PERMIT-PB-001`, `GATE-DESIGN-FREEZE-CD`,
  `GATE-PERMIT-READY`; green-terrace-2028 — `PERMIT-OCCUPANCY-001`,
  `GATE-COMPLETION-AUTHORIZED`, `INSP-ANNUAL-2027`, `INSP-5YEAR-DUE-2028`
  (c-KOB recorded); green-terrace-park — `PERMIT-CAMPUS-MASTER`,
  `GATE-CAMPUS-PLANNING` (campus-level coordination, blocked by
  `ISS-CAMPUS-PLANNING-001`).
- **New sidebar entries** for every new page, in both locales.

### Changed

- `sbm_version` "2.3" → "2.4" in compiler output + schema const.
- Compiler `VERSION` 2.3.0 → 2.4.0.
- New `V2_4_ENTITY_TYPES` set in constants; `ALL_ENTITY_TYPES` extended; parse
  `validTypes` extended.
- Normalize: 3 new buckets + 3 output spread entries + 3 metadata count entries.
- Validate: light v2.4 cross-entity rules (dangling `relatedEntityIds` / permit /
  issue refs → warning; permit `expiryDate < validFrom` → error; a `passed`
  approval_gate with an unmet prerequisite → warning).
- Quality: profiles added for all 3 new entity types.
- Targets: `compliance-report` gains a `deliveryAndApprovals` section (permits /
  gates / inspections with outstanding-item rollups); `twin-schema` surfaces the
  `regulatory_inspections` schedule; `html-report` gains a bilingual
  "Delivery & approvals" section.
- Tests: 3 new `describe` blocks (12 tests) in `validate.test.mjs`; `sbm_version`
  fixtures bumped 2.3 → 2.4. **130/130 pass** (was 118).

### Migration

- Bump the `sbm_version` field to `"2.4"`. No other changes required — additive
  schema only. All v2.0 / v2.2 / v2.3 models validate cleanly under v2.4.

### Significance

The SBM standard now spans the full lifecycle question set: *what the building
**is*** (design/spatial entities), *how it **performs*** (operational analytics,
v2.2/v2.3), and *how it gets **built and governed*** (regulatory delivery &
approval, v2.4). The Polish examples show the same entity types at three
lifecycle phases — front-end permitting, post-handover occupancy + statutory
inspection, and multi-building campus coordination.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-24 — All operation-phase SCHEMA-GAPS resolved: occupant_survey + energy_verification_record + retrocx_recommendation

Second schema bump in one day. Closes the remaining 3 gaps from the
operation-phase SCHEMA-GAPS inventory. **All 5 gaps that triggered the
v2.x operation-phase work are now resolved with first-class entities.**
Additive only — every v2.2-conforming model is also v2.3-conforming.

### Added

- **New `occupant_survey` entity type (29th).** Structured Likert-scale
  + free-text occupant feedback with anonymised quotes carrying
  `affectedEntityId` + `triggeredIssueId` cross-links. ID `^SURVEY-...$`.
- **New `energy_verification_record` entity type (30th).** In-use energy
  reconciliation with measured vs designTargets blocks, verdict enum, and
  `deltaAnalysis` per-factor attribution to assets / entities / related
  issues. ID `^EVR-...$`.
- **New `retrocx_recommendation` entity type (31st).** Retro-commissioning
  as a first-class lifecycle distinct from generic Issue.
  `triggeredByIssueIds` + `triggeredBySurveyId` + `triggeredByTelemetryStreamId`
  capture the full causal chain; `expectedOutcome` + `verificationPlan`
  add a typed verification loop. ID `^RCX-...$`.
- **`schemas/sbm-schema-v2.3.json`** — new schema file (v2.0 + v2.2 stay
  frozen for reference).
- **3 v2.3 entities retrofitted into Green Terrace 2028** (EN + PL):
  `SURVEY-BLD-01-IEQ-2027`, `EVR-BLD-01-2027` (with 3-factor delta
  attribution to HP COP drift / MVHR HR drift / air-tightness slip),
  `RCX-MVHR-001` (linking telemetry → issue → survey → recommendation →
  verification as one structured record).
- **3 new sidebar entries per locale** under the operation-phase example.

### Changed

- `sbm_version` "2.2" → "2.3" in compiler output + schema const.
- Compiler `VERSION` 2.2.0 → 2.3.0.
- New `V2_3_ENTITY_TYPES` set in constants; `ALL_ENTITY_TYPES` extended.
- Normalize: 3 new buckets + 3 new output spread entries + 3 new
  metadata count entries.
- Tests: 3 test files updated to assert `sbm_version: '2.3'`. 104/104 pass.
- SCHEMA-GAPS.md gap-resolution banner updated to **"ALL FIVE GAPS RESOLVED"**.
- Narrative companion pages (`tenant-survey-summary`, `energy-verification`)
  kept alongside their v2.3 entity counterparts as reader-friendly summaries.

### Migration

- Bump `sbm_version` field to `"2.3"`. No other changes required
  (additive schema only). All v2.0 + v2.2 models validate cleanly under v2.3.

### Significance

This release **completes the operation-phase modelling story** that
started with the Green Terrace 2028 example. The SBM standard now has
typed entities for every operation-phase pattern surfaced by that
example: time-series telemetry, asset operational history, occupant
feedback, in-use energy verification, and retro-commissioning. Future
operation-phase examples can be authored entirely in structured form.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-24 — Operation-phase schema extensions: telemetry_stream + asset.operationalHistory

The first schema bump since v2.0. Additive only — every v2.0-conforming
model is also v2.2-conforming. Resolves the top two gaps from the
`SCHEMA-GAPS.md` inventory surfaced by the Green Terrace 2028
operation-phase example.

### Added

- **New `telemetry_stream` entity type (28th entity).** Wraps a
  continuous numeric data stream (BMS point, sub-meter, IoT device) with:
  a `dataReference` (file path or live protocol: file_csv, bacnet, mqtt, etc.),
  human-asserted or compiler-computed `summaryStatistics` (min/max/mean/median
  + rolling means over arbitrary windows), explicit `thresholds` (design
  target, regulatory limit, operator alarm, energy baseline, comfort band)
  with `currentlyExceeded` state + `exceededSince` date, and `qualityMetadata`
  (coverage fraction, outage events, calibration valid-until).
  ID pattern `^TEL-[A-Z0-9-]+$`. Each stream references its measured entity
  via `measuredEntityId` + `measuredEntityType` (space, system, asset,
  building, level, envelope, site_feature).
- **`asset.operationalHistory` structured sub-schema.** Adds typed fields
  to the `asset` entity for: `runtimeHours` + `runtimeHoursAsOf`,
  `cycleCount`, `energyConsumed_kWh`, `filterChangeCount`,
  `zoneValveReplacements`, a chronological `servicedAt` array (date, type
  enum [planned_inspection / warranty_repair / unplanned_repair /
  parts_replacement / filter_change / rebalancing / zone_valve_replacement /
  recommissioning / decommission / other], technician, findings, cost_eur,
  relatedIssueId), `performanceTrend` (asset-type-specific via
  additionalProperties), and `dataSource` (link to underlying telemetry).
  Previously these fields had to live in opaque `additionalProperties`
  blobs — now they're typed + queryable.
- **`asset.activeIssueIds`** — array of operation-phase issue IDs currently
  affecting the asset. Lets the compiler render cross-entity lineage in
  the asset register target.
- **`schemas/sbm-schema-v2.2.json`** — new schema file (the v2.0 schema
  stays frozen for reference, per convention).
- **2 telemetry_stream entities** retrofitted into the Green Terrace 2028
  example (EN + PL): `TEL-CO2-402-001` (driving the CO₂ anomaly issue)
  and `TEL-HP-COP-001` (driving the post-warranty COP drift narrative).
  Replaces the v2.0 "narrative + external CSV reference" pattern with
  first-class queryable entities.

### Changed

- **`sbm_version` bumped to "2.2"** in compiler output + schema const.
  The compiler now emits and validates against the v2.2 schema by default.
- **Compiler version**: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0
- **Constants**: new `V2_2_ENTITY_TYPES` set with `telemetry_stream`;
  `ALL_ENTITY_TYPES` extended. `parse.mjs validTypes` extended.
- **Normalize stage**: `telemetry_streams` bucket added to `grouped`,
  to the output `entities:` spread, and to `metadata.entitiesByType`
  counts (following the same pattern as the v2.0 bucket fix from the
  previous Unreleased section).
- **Tests**: 3 test files updated to assert against `sbm_version: '2.2'`
  instead of `'2.0'`. 104/104 tests still pass.
- **SCHEMA-GAPS.md** in the 2028 example now notes gaps #1 (telemetry_stream)
  and #2 (asset.operationalHistory) as **RESOLVED in v2.2**. Gaps #3-#5
  (occupant_survey, energy_verification_record, retrocx_recommendation as
  first-class lifecycle) remain candidates for v2.3+.

### Migration

- Existing v2.0 models continue to validate cleanly under the v2.2 schema
  (additive changes only). Just bump the `sbm_version` field to `"2.2"`.
- To opt into the new `telemetry_stream` entity, create `TEL-*.md` files
  in your input directory under a `telemetry-streams/` folder (or any
  folder — the compiler scans recursively).
- To opt into typed `asset.operationalHistory`, replace any opaque
  `additionalProperties` representation with the typed sub-schema.

## [Unreleased] — Green Terrace v2.1 example refresh + operation-phase showcase + compiler v2.0 bucket fix

Post-2.1.0. Three bundled changes: (a) full normalization of the
Green Terrace flagship example to v2.0 schema + 10-phase lifecycle
coverage with 11 new v2.0 entities, (b) new sibling example
**Green Terrace 2028** demonstrating the operation lifecycle phase
with measured commissioning results, asset operational history,
6 operation-phase issues, and a SCHEMA-GAPS inventory listing v2.2
proposals, (c) compiler bug fix where v2.0 entity buckets
(`space_programs`, `material_types`, `materials`, `structural_systems`,
`issues`, `commissioning_tests`, `circulation_routes`, `campuses`) were
grouped during normalize but never emitted to sbm.json output.
SBM standard itself unchanged (sbm_version stays 2.0).

### Added
- **Green Terrace v2.1 refresh** — 11 new v2.0 entities cover the
  remaining lifecycle phases: `PROG-BEDROOM-STANDARD` (concept brief),
  `STR-GREEN-TERRACE` + `MT-CONCRETE-C30-37` + `MT-INSULATION-PIR-150`
  (DD-phase structural + materials extracted from prose into queryable
  entities), `CR-FIRE-EGRESS-L01` (CD-phase circulation route),
  3 Issues spanning bidding + construction, 3 scheduled
  Commissioning Tests. Updated index narrative with a Lifecycle
  Walkthrough table mapping every phase to its example entity.
  Bedrooms 4.02 ↔ corridor inheritance + brief-to-design check now
  trigger an intentional under_provision warning (2 designed of 27
  programmed — pedagogical scope, documented in PROG entity notes).
- **Green Terrace 2028 sibling example** — same BLD-01, 22 months
  post-handover. 45 files (EN + PL parity). All 3 commissioning tests
  have `results.measured` populated; one came back as a conditional
  pass and triggered a downstream non-conformance issue. 3 assets
  carry 22 months of operational history (runtime hours, service
  events, performance trend). 6 operation-phase issues span warranty
  (HP compressor batch defect), tenant maintenance request, BMS-detected
  CO₂ anomaly, retro-commissioning recommendation, annual fire
  inspection finding, and an 18-month air-tightness NCR. Post-occupancy
  energy verification (47 vs 45 kWh/m²/year — Class B confirmed) and
  tenant IEQ survey summary as narrative docs.
- **SCHEMA-GAPS.md inventory** in the 2028 example — 5 places where
  v2.0 doesn't cleanly model operation-phase needs, with proposed v2.2
  shapes: `telemetry_stream`, `asset.operationalHistory` sub-schema,
  `occupant_survey`, `energy_verification_record`, and
  `retrocx_recommendation`. Input to v2.2 standard discussion.
- **npm scripts**: `sbm:validate:2028` + `sbm:compile:2028` (uses
  `--phase operation` to opt into operation-phase gate behaviour).
- **VitePress sidebar**: new "Green Terrace 2028 (Operation Phase)"
  collapsible section in both locales.

### Fixed
- **Compiler: v2.0 entity buckets dropped from sbm.json output.**
  `scripts/compiler/stages/normalize.mjs` grouped v2.0 entities
  (campuses, space_programs, material_types, materials, structural_systems,
  issues, commissioning_tests, circulation_routes) correctly but the
  `entities:` spread and `metadata.entitiesByType` block only listed v1
  buckets. v2.0 entities parsed + validated but disappeared from output.
  Now all 8 v2.0 buckets are conditionally emitted alongside v1 buckets.
  Surfaced by the v2.1 example refresh.
- **Green Terrace example**: every entity bumped to `version: "2.1.0"`
  (was patchwork of "0.4.0" / "1.0.0" / "2.0.0"). project-specification.md
  legacy `documentType: "project"` removed (entityType retained) and
  legacy numeric `phase: 4` normalized to canonical `phase: "construction_documents"`.
  Requirement files: non-canonical phase strings (`construction_documentation`,
  `handover`, `schematic`, `as_built`) normalized to the 10-phase enum.
  Stripped "NEW v0.4" / "SBM v0.4 Summary" labelling cruft from
  project-specification.

### Earlier post-2.1.0 work (Polish localization + Project-at-a-glance diagrams)

Already-merged work since v2.1.0, kept in this Unreleased section pending
the next tagged release. Closes the bilingual-parity gaps surfaced after
the report i18n fix and adds three schematic SVG diagrams to the report.
SBM standard unchanged.

### Added
- **Project-at-a-glance diagrams** — new compiler target `targets/diagrams.mjs`
  generating three SVGs derived from existing data (no schema changes):
  - **Massing (LOD 100)** — oblique axonometric extruded box from
    building.footprintArea / buildingHeight / numberOfStoreys, with
    floor lines at level elevations + eave marker.
  - **Stacking** — vertical level bands sized by floor-to-floor height,
    coloured by predominant space type, labelled with elevation, level
    name, space count and area.
  - **Adjacency & connections** — space node-link graph from
    openings.spaceIds, with zone-membership chips (fire/HVAC/acoustic)
    per space.
  - Embedded in `report.html` as a "Project at a glance" panel at the
    top; localised per project.language (EN/PL).

### Fixed
- **Report fully localized.** Recommendation/blocker text and compliance
  status values were English even for Polish projects. `quality-report.mjs`
  now emits stable machine `code`s; `html-report.mjs` renders
  recommendations/blockers/status in the project language. The Polish
  Green Terrace report is now 100% Polish (chrome + recommendations +
  status); JSON targets stay English/stable for machine consumers.
- **PL docs English sweep.** Pre-existing untracked English prose (verbatim
  EN copies) in the Polish flagship example and reference/authoring pages
  translated to domain-accurate Polish: the 3 requirement specs
  (REQ-FIRE-EGRESS / ACOUSTIC-B / FIRE-RATING), system/asset/zone/space
  type examples, `encje/wymaganie` & `encje/poziom` JSON example blocks,
  `tworzenie/*` authoring examples — descriptions, requirements, warranty
  terms, maintenance tasks, deliverables, notes, role titles. Canonical
  schema vocabulary (entityType/documentType/usage/status enums, phase &
  confidence identifiers) intentionally remains identical in both locales,
  as in the standard.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-19 — Coherence, demoability & presentation

A tooling + documentation release. The **SBM standard itself is unchanged**
(`sbm_version` stays `2.0`, schema `2.0.0`) — this release makes the v2.0
substance internally consistent, demoable, and easy to present/explore.
Covers Tracks A (coherence), B (demoable), and C (streamlined IA).

### Changed
- **Canonical name** is now **"Semantic Building Model"** everywhere
  (schema v2.0 title, CHANGELOG, site/locale titles, CLAUDE.md). Frozen
  historical schemas (v0.4/v1.0/v1.1) intentionally keep their original title.
- **Phase model fully unified to the 10 named lifecycle phases.** The
  pre-v2.0 8-step LOD vocabulary and the compiler's numeric `phase` are
  retired in favour of `concept … decommissioned`:
  - Compiler emits named phases (`phaseRank`/`phaseName`, `PHASE_GATE`,
    `DEFAULT_PHASE=design_development`); legacy numeric `--phase`/`phase:`
    still accepted via `LEGACY_PHASE_MAP`.
  - Schema `project.phase` → `oneOf(unified-name enum | legacy int 1-8)`.
  - `docs/{en/phases,pl/fazy}/`: 8 legacy pages → 10 unified-phase pages +
    a canonical lifecycle index (old→new migration + gate tables); full
    EN/PL parity. Nav/sidebars rebuilt; triplicated "workflow" links removed;
    241 cross-references remapped.
- Landing pages: "8 Project Phases" → 10-phase lifecycle; "19 types" → 27.

### Fixed
- Compiler dropped a declared `project.budget`, forcing PL projects to
  PLN and producing spurious cross-entity currency warnings — now respects
  declared currency (country only as fallback).
- Green Terrace flagship: budget migrated v0.4→v2.0 shape; missing
  `building`/levels/asset-types added; dangling refs fixed
  (25 → 7 warnings; the 7 are legitimate requirement-scope info).
- `.gitignore` un-anchored `examples/` rule was silently un-tracking the
  flagship example under `docs/en/examples/`.

### Added
- **Human-readable HTML report** compiler target (`report.html`) — a
  self-contained printable page (lifecycle position, requirement
  verification progress, data quality, regulatory compliance) for
  clients/principals. `npm run sbm:report` one-command showcase; a live
  sample is published at `/green-terrace-report.html`.

### Removed
- Unrelated XanoScript scaffold (340 untracked files) that had been
  dumped into this docs repo.

### Track B notes
- Output reframed: pre-`construction_documents` pending verification is
  presented as expected progress, not a compliance-failure score.
  Requirement scope-filter notes moved from warnings to `--verbose`
  debug; Green Terrace flagship now validates with zero warnings.

### Track C notes — present & explore
- **Quick-start** cut from 742 lines to a true ~110-line 5-minute path
  (one file → references → compile → HTML report); EN/PL parity restored.
- **Pitch deduplicated**: the "why" lived verbatim on the landing,
  `introduction.md` and the quick-start. `introduction.md` is now the
  single canonical rationale; landing trimmed 293→~115 (hero + features +
  teaser + persona routing); quick-start links out instead of repeating.
- **Green Terrace** reframed from a 376-line flat file dump into a ~95-line
  guided tour that follows one bedroom (instance → type/level inheritance →
  overlapping zones → cascaded requirements → cost rollup → HTML report).
- **Information architecture**: overlapping nav sprawl collapsed to six
  clear groups — Start · Model · Lifecycle · Compiler · Example ·
  Reference (EN+PL). Content directories unchanged on disk.
