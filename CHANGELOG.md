## [Unreleased] — Polish localization completeness + Project-at-a-glance diagrams

Post-2.1.0. Closes the bilingual-parity gaps surfaced after the report
i18n fix and adds three schematic SVG diagrams to the report. SBM
standard unchanged.

### Added
- **Project-at-a-glance diagrams** — new compiler target `targets/diagrams.mjs`
  generating three SVGs derived from existing data (no schema changes):
  - **Massing (LOD 100)** — oblique axonometric extruded box from
    building.footprintArea / buildingHeight / numberOfStoreys, with
    floor lines at level elevations + eave marker.
  - **Stacking** — vertical level bands sized by floor-to-floor height,
    coloured by predominant space type, labelled with elevation, level
    name, space count and area.
  - **Adjacency & connections** — space node-link graph from
    openings.spaceIds, with zone-membership chips (fire/HVAC/acoustic)
    per space.
  - Embedded in `report.html` as a "Project at a glance" panel at the
    top; localised per project.language (EN/PL).

### Fixed
- **Report fully localized.** Recommendation/blocker text and compliance
  status values were English even for Polish projects. `quality-report.mjs`
  now emits stable machine `code`s; `html-report.mjs` renders
  recommendations/blockers/status in the project language. The Polish
  Green Terrace report is now 100% Polish (chrome + recommendations +
  status); JSON targets stay English/stable for machine consumers.
- **PL docs English sweep.** Pre-existing untracked English prose (verbatim
  EN copies) in the Polish flagship example and reference/authoring pages
  translated to domain-accurate Polish: the 3 requirement specs
  (REQ-FIRE-EGRESS / ACOUSTIC-B / FIRE-RATING), system/asset/zone/space
  type examples, `encje/wymaganie` & `encje/poziom` JSON example blocks,
  `tworzenie/*` authoring examples — descriptions, requirements, warranty
  terms, maintenance tasks, deliverables, notes, role titles. Canonical
  schema vocabulary (entityType/documentType/usage/status enums, phase &
  confidence identifiers) intentionally remains identical in both locales,
  as in the standard.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-19 — Coherence, demoability & presentation

A tooling + documentation release. The **SBM standard itself is unchanged**
(`sbm_version` stays `2.0`, schema `2.0.0`) — this release makes the v2.0
substance internally consistent, demoable, and easy to present/explore.
Covers Tracks A (coherence), B (demoable), and C (streamlined IA).

### Changed
- **Canonical name** is now **"Semantic Building Model"** everywhere
  (schema v2.0 title, CHANGELOG, site/locale titles, CLAUDE.md). Frozen
  historical schemas (v0.4/v1.0/v1.1) intentionally keep their original title.
- **Phase model fully unified to the 10 named lifecycle phases.** The
  pre-v2.0 8-step LOD vocabulary and the compiler's numeric `phase` are
  retired in favour of `concept … decommissioned`:
  - Compiler emits named phases (`phaseRank`/`phaseName`, `PHASE_GATE`,
    `DEFAULT_PHASE=design_development`); legacy numeric `--phase`/`phase:`
    still accepted via `LEGACY_PHASE_MAP`.
  - Schema `project.phase` → `oneOf(unified-name enum | legacy int 1-8)`.
  - `docs/{en/phases,pl/fazy}/`: 8 legacy pages → 10 unified-phase pages +
    a canonical lifecycle index (old→new migration + gate tables); full
    EN/PL parity. Nav/sidebars rebuilt; triplicated "workflow" links removed;
    241 cross-references remapped.
- Landing pages: "8 Project Phases" → 10-phase lifecycle; "19 types" → 27.

### Fixed
- Compiler dropped a declared `project.budget`, forcing PL projects to
  PLN and producing spurious cross-entity currency warnings — now respects
  declared currency (country only as fallback).
- Green Terrace flagship: budget migrated v0.4→v2.0 shape; missing
  `building`/levels/asset-types added; dangling refs fixed
  (25 → 7 warnings; the 7 are legitimate requirement-scope info).
- `.gitignore` un-anchored `examples/` rule was silently un-tracking the
  flagship example under `docs/en/examples/`.

### Added
- **Human-readable HTML report** compiler target (`report.html`) — a
  self-contained printable page (lifecycle position, requirement
  verification progress, data quality, regulatory compliance) for
  clients/principals. `npm run sbm:report` one-command showcase; a live
  sample is published at `/green-terrace-report.html`.

### Removed
- Unrelated XanoScript scaffold (340 untracked files) that had been
  dumped into this docs repo.

### Track B notes
- Output reframed: pre-`construction_documents` pending verification is
  presented as expected progress, not a compliance-failure score.
  Requirement scope-filter notes moved from warnings to `--verbose`
  debug; Green Terrace flagship now validates with zero warnings.

### Track C notes — present & explore
- **Quick-start** cut from 742 lines to a true ~110-line 5-minute path
  (one file → references → compile → HTML report); EN/PL parity restored.
- **Pitch deduplicated**: the "why" lived verbatim on the landing,
  `introduction.md` and the quick-start. `introduction.md` is now the
  single canonical rationale; landing trimmed 293→~115 (hero + features +
  teaser + persona routing); quick-start links out instead of repeating.
- **Green Terrace** reframed from a 376-line flat file dump into a ~95-line
  guided tour that follows one bedroom (instance → type/level inheritance →
  overlapping zones → cascaded requirements → cost rollup → HTML report).
- **Information architecture**: overlapping nav sprawl collapsed to six
  clear groups — Start · Model · Lifecycle · Compiler · Example ·
  Reference (EN+PL). Content directories unchanged on disk.
